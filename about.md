# Nostradamus
Michel de Nostredame, usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French astrologer, physician and reputed seer, who is best known for his book **Les Prophéties**, a collection of 942 poetic quatrains allegedly predicting future events. The book was first published in 1555.

* 1531:	In 1531 Nostradamus was invited by Jules-César Scaliger, a leading Renaissance scholar, to come to *Agen*.  
* 1534:	In 1534 his wife and children died, presumably from the plague.  
* 1534:	Nostradamus married Henriette d'Encausse in 1534; their marriage lasted 3 years till 1537.  
* 1550:	The Almanacs, by far the most popular of his works, were published annually from 1550 until his death.  
* 1561:	His brief imprisonment at *Marignane* in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.  
* 1566:	By 1566, Nostradamus's gout, which had plagued him painfully for many years and made movement very difficult, turned into edema.
